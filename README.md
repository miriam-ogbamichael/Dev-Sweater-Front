# Dev-Sweater-Front

## Application

Dev-Sweater is a full-stack E-commerce web application where users can purchase sweaters using Stripe Checkout technology. This application was broken into two parts: `Dev-Sweater-Front` & `Dev-Sweater-Back`. The `Dev-Sweater-Front` is the client side of the application, designed to communicate with `Dev-Sweater-Back` API, so that a user can go through the process of purchasing a product.

## Planning Story

We started by creating the ERD, Wireframes and the user stories our applicatin needed. Using Agile Methodologies we conducted daily stand ups spearheaded by the SCRUM Master and the SCRUM Team Coordinator to plan all the sprints required for the successful completion of the project. We then created the API for Dev-Sweater before moving onto the client side of the application to test the API routes we created. After successful testing, we added styling to the client side and deployed both the API and the client of the application.
